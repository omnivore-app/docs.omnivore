All major functionality in the Omnivore web client is available via the keyboard. There are two ways to use the keyboard within Omnivore: by opening the command bar and typing a command name or by using a keyboard command directly.

Currently, keyboard functionality is only available on the web.

You can view all available keyboard commands by tapping the `?` key.

## Library Keyboard Commands

Most library commands act upon the currently selected item. For example, to archive a library item, you would first select it and then tap `e` or use the command bar to archive the item.

To select items in the library use the arrow keys or the j and k keys. If your library is in grid mode the arrow keys allow navigating `up`/`down` and `left`/`right`. The `j` and `k` keys will navigate forward and backward.

- `enter`: open the selected library item
- `o`: open the original version
- `l`: set labels on the selected item
- `e`: archive the selected item
- `r`: remove the item
- `shift` `i`: Mark as read
- `shift` `u`: Mark as unread

### Adding Links with the keyboard

Tap the `a` key to open the Add Link dialog

### Using the keyboard with search in the library

Use the `/` key in the library view to start a search. To clear your current search tap the `x` key.

## Reader Keyboard Commands

Within the reader you can adjust your display settings, margins, line spacing, and theme using keyboard commands. You can also perform actions on items, like archiving and deleting from the reader view.

### Creating highlights

When you have text selected in the reader view, you can create a highlight by tapping `h`. If you'd like to create a highlight with a note, tap `n`.

### Changing Display Settings

- `d`: open the display settings modal

### Article Actions

- `e`: archive the current article
- `l`: set labels
- `o`: open the original version of the article

## Moving between views using the keyboard

You can move between views in Omnivore using the keyboard. To read a library item first select it, and then use enter to open it in the reader view. When you finish reading, you can archive it and return to the library using ‘e’ or use the ‘u’ key to move “up” to the library.

## Accessing the Command bar

The command bar allows you to type commands. Open the command bar using CMD+K on MacOS, or CTRL+K on Windows.
